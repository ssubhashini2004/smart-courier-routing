# Smart Courier Routing System using Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Smart Courier Routing System** using the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The system determines the most optimal delivery route for couriers by minimizing the travel distance between multiple delivery addresses. The project uses **Dynamic Programming** and **Bitmasking** to solve the TSP problem efficiently.

## Features
- **User Input for Delivery Points**: Users can input the number of delivery addresses along with their coordinates.
- **Graph Visualization**: The delivery locations and routes are displayed on a canvas.
- **Optimal Route Calculation**: The system determines the shortest path using TSP and displays step-by-step delivery instructions.
- **Interactive UI**: A web-based interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-**Instruction Display**: The instructions are displayed step by step for the user to follow the most optimal path.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS** (for frontend UI)
- **JavaScript** (for logic and visualization)
- **Canvas API** (for drawing the delivery graph)
- **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking** (for solving TSP)
